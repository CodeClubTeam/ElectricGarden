## Understanding {#understanding}

### **Understanding** the Garden through **Data**

<br />

###### The Electric Garden sends us numbers that represent **measurements** of conditions in the garden.

###### The EG online platform arranges these values in a **graph** for us to see and make sense of.

<br />

###### But what do these numbers **really mean** about the **real world conditions** out in the garden?

###### Let's practise using the information in the graphs to understand **the story behind the data**.

<br />

#### **13.** Light in the Garden

###### Look at the section of the graph where **the line goes flat at 0**.

###### We see the brightness level **drop to 0** by 6pm and stay there for **13 hours** until 7am the next day.

![graph_light](./graph_light.png)

###### According to the data, this means that the garden went dark between **6pm Wednesday** and **7am Thursday**.

###### _What do you think happened in the garden? What story does this data tell us?_

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Choose the best explanation for what the data shows us has happened here:"
    choices={[
        {
            label:
                'Daylight dimmed until the sun set by 6pm. It was dark all night, then daylight returned when the sun came up at 7am the next day',
            correct: true,
            feedback:
                "Ka pai, nice one! You're starting to see the meaning behind the data!",
        },
        {
            label:
                'Someone put a blanket over the Electric Garden at 6pm and uncovered it at 7am the next morning',
            feedback:
                'Hmmm, how likely is this story? Not impossble, but definitely not the best explanation!',
        },
        {
            label:
                "The Electric Garden sleeps at night like us, so it didn't collect any data between its bedtime at 6pm and when it woke up at 7am",
            feedback: "Kāore, digital devices don't need sleep like we do!",
        },
        {
            label:
                'The Electric Garden decided to close its eyes and meditate between 6pm and 7am while all of the students were home for the evening',
            feedback:
                "Kāore, e hoa, the Electric Garden doesn't have eyes to close!",
        },
    ]}
/>

#### **14.** Temperature in the Garden

###### Look at the section of the graph where **the line sinks below 0, then jumps back up**.

###### We see the temperature drop steadily from **6pm**, hit a low of **-1°C**, then rise quickly to **22°C** by **9am** the next morning.

![graph_temp](./graph_temp.png)

###### According to the data, this means it got colder and colder, dipped below freezing, then suddenly much warmer!

###### _What do you think happened in the garden? What story does this data tell us?_

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Choose the best explanation for what the data shows us has happened here:"
    choices={[
        {
            label:
                'It got colder after 6pm as the sun set, kept getting colder in the dark over night, frosted first thing in the morning, then warmed up quickly after sunrise on a beautiful sunny day',
            correct: true,
            feedback:
                "Ka pai, nice one! You're starting to see the meaning behind the data!",
        },
        {
            label:
                'Someone covered the air probe with ice cubes at 8am before school, then they melted in the sun',
            feedback:
                'Hmmm, how likely is this story? Not impossble, but definitely not the best explanation!',
        },
        {
            label:
                "The Electric Garden got a digital cold overnight and wasn't feeling well until it took digital medicine in the morning",
            feedback: "Kāore, digital devices don't get sick like we do!",
        },
        {
            label:
                'Someone put the Electric Garden in the refrigerator overnight, in the freezer during breakfast, then by the heater at school in the morning',
            feedback:
                "Kāore, e hoa, I don't think anyone went to all this effort...and if they did they have some explaining to do!",
        },
    ]}
/>

#### **15.** Soil in the Garden

###### Look at the section of the graph where **the line suddenly jumps**.

###### We see the moisture level leap from around **1.3%** up to around **5.3%** in the space of **one hour**.

![graph_soil](./graph_soil.png)

###### According to the data, this means that the soil got **wet** between **5pm** and **6pm**!

###### _What do you think happened in the garden? What story does this data tell us?_
