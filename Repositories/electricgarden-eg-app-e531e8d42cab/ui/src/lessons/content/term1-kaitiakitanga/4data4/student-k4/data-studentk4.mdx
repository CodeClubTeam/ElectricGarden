###### We can try to learn even more by **overlapping** the different data sets on the same graph.

###### Then, we can look for **patterns between the different conditions** and better understand how they are related.

## Programming with Lists {#prog-list}

### **Using Lists in Trinket**

<Figure align={'left'}>
    <ImageWithBorder src={trinketbanner} radius={'5px'} />
</Figure>

<br />

##### Remember that **Trinket** is a tool that lets us practise our **programming** skills.

##### Previously we learned about **variables**, or terms that can store information in programs.

##### Now let's use Trinket to explore using **lists** to organise data and create graphs!

### What is a **list**?

<Captioned>
    He aha <b>he rārangi</b>?
</Captioned>

##### In programming, a list is a way of storing **a series of data** as **a sequence of values in order**.

<br />

<Captioned font={'Comfortaa'} size={'25'}>
    <b>list</b> = a collection of data stored as a <b>series</b>, in a{' '}
    <b>particular order</b>
</Captioned>

<br />

##### For example, data from each Electric Garden sensor will contain many numbers for lots of measurements collected over time.

##### In order to make any sense of them, these numbers must be **grouped together** and arranged in their **proper order**.

##### A list is an important tool for organising big (sometimes massive!) sets of information that belong together in order.

<br />

#### **19.** So, which answer best describes a list?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="In programming, a list is:"
    choices={[
        {
            label: 'a collection of related data in an ordered sequence',
            correct: true,
            feedback: "Ka pai, you've got it!",
        },
        {
            label:
                'a table of things to check off before we can start programming',
            feedback: "Kāore, that's a 'checklist'!",
        },
        {
            label: 'a random selection of data that looks good together',
            feedback: 'Kāore, no way! Not random!',
        },
        {
            label: 'a long line of code in a computer program',
            feedback: 'Kāore, that could be any type of code!',
        },
    ]}
/>

## Drawing Graphs with Trinket {#draw-graphs}

### **From Lists to Graphs**

###### The Electric Garden uses programming to collect data, sort it into lists, and translate it into graphs.

###### Let's use the programming language Python with Trinket to practise pulling data from a list to draw graphs.

<br />

#### **Step A)** Formatting our graph:

##### First, we need to figure our what **type of graph** we want to use.

#### **20.** Which type of graph would be best for showing our EG data?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Select the most suitable type of graph:"
    choices={[
        {
            label: 'Line Graph',
            correct: true,
            image: linegraph4,
            feedback:
                'From our lesson, we know that the best format for showing data over time is a line graph (kauwhata rārangi).',
        },
        {
            label: 'Bar Graph',
            image: bargraph4,
            feedback:
                'From our lesson, do you remember what kinds of patterns a bar graph is good at showing?',
        },
        {
            label: 'Pie Graph',
            image: piegraph4,
            feedback:
                'From our lesson, do you remember what kinds of patterns a pie graph is good at showing?',
        },
        {
            label: 'Circle Graph',
            image: circlegraph1,
            feedback:
                'From our lesson, do you remember covering the use of circle graphs at all?',
        },
    ]}
/>

<br />

##### Next, we next need to tell Trinket where the information goes on the graph:

#### **21.** How should we arrange the information on our graph?

##### **Label the x- and y-axis with the type of data they should show:**

<MatchingActivity
    unmatched={[]}
    feedback={{
        success:
            'Kei te pai! From our lesson, we know that time tracks well along the horizontal bottom (x-axis), and the measurements track well along the vertical side (y-axis).',
        fail: 'Not quite, try again!',
    }}
    background={
        <Image
            src={graphaxis}
            tooltip="Graph for labelling the x and y axes"
            width={700}
        />
    }
    direction={{
        candidates: 'down',
        targets: 'right',
    }}
    positions={{ candidates: { top: 0, right: 0 } }}
    targetStyles={{ border: '1px black dashed' }}
    randomOrder={{
        candidates: true,
        targets: false,
    }}
>
    <MatchTarget
        matches={[<TextBox maxWidth={14}>Time of Day</TextBox>]}
        position={{ left: 365, top: 225 }}
    >
        <Box width={240} height={90} />
    </MatchTarget>
    <MatchTarget
        matches={[<TextBox maxWidth={14}>Sensor Measurements</TextBox>]}
        position={{ left: 180, top: 60 }}
    >
        <Box width={90} height={180} />
    </MatchTarget>
</MatchingActivity>

###

#### **Step B)** Pulling data from a list:

##### Now that we have a format for our graph, we need to tell Trinket what data to show.

##### We want to make a graph with data from the Electric Garden's **air temperature sensor**.

<br />

<Figure>
    <ImageWithBorder src={airtempeg} border="true" />
</Figure>

#### **22.** In this case, which line of code will tell our program to pull from the list we want?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Select the correct line of code:"
    choices={[
        {
            label: "linechart.add('Air Temp', airtemp_list)",
            correct: true,
            feedback:
                'Ka rawe! You noticed the correct variable for the air temperature sensor!',
        },
        { label: "linechart.add('Soil Temp', soiltemp_list)" },
        { label: "linechart.add('Humidity', humidity_list)" },
        { label: "linechart.add('Soil Moisture', soilmoisture_list)" },
        { label: "linechart.add('Light', light_list)" },
    ]}
/>

<br />

##### _Once we have our data set, we can let Trinket know that we're ready to **render**, or draw, the graph!_

###

#### **Step C)** Inputing the code into Trinket:

##### Based on our decisions from steps A and B, here are the lines of code we need to use:

<CollapsablePanel
    heading={
        <p>This line of code tells the program what type of graph we want:</p>
    }
>
    <code>linechart = pygal.Line()</code>
</CollapsablePanel>

<CollapsablePanel
    heading={<p>This line of code tells the program how to label the graph:</p>}
>
    <code>linechart.x_labels = map(str, time_list)</code>
</CollapsablePanel>

<CollapsablePanel
    heading={
        <p>This line of code tells the program which list to pull data from:</p>
    }
>
    <code>linechart.add('Air Temp', airtemp_list)</code>
</CollapsablePanel>

<CollapsablePanel
    heading={
        <p>Finally, this line of code tells the program to draw our graph:</p>
    }
>
    <code>linechart.render()</code>
</CollapsablePanel>

<br />

##### Now that we have all our pieces of code, let's put them in Trinket to create our program:

<br />

##### Starting from **Line 30**, carefully type out these lines of code into the Trinket:

<ExampleCode showLineNumbers startingLineNumber={30}>
    {`linechart = pygal.Line()
linechart.x_labels = map(str, time_list)
linechart.add('Air Temp', airtemp_list)
linechart.render()`}
</ExampleCode>

<Trinket trinketId="python/642b454c74" height="600" />

##### _**Note:** Remember to take care to get all of the spelling, spaces, and symbols just right!_

###

#### **Step D)** Run the program!

##### When you're ready, click the **run** button to draw your graph!

<Figure align={'left'}>
    <ImageWithBorder src={run} radius={''} />
</Figure>

<br />

#### **Did you successfully draw the graph?**

##### Answer these questions by using the airtemp sensor data from your Trinket graph above.

#### **23.** What was the **hottest temperature (°C)** recorded over the two days shown in the graph?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Choose the correct temperature:"
    choices={[
        {
            label: '26.8°C',
            correct: true,
            feedback:
                'Ka pai, sweet as! You programmed the graph then discovered that 26.8 was the highest reading during this period of time!',
        },
        {
            label: '23.4°C',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
        {
            label: '25.6°C',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
        {
            label: '20.2°C',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
    ]}
/>

#### **24.** In the graph, can you see a **trend (clear direction)** in the data **between 6am and 3pm** on both days?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Which answer describes the trend you see during this time period?"
    choices={[
        {
            label: 'Yes, trending upwards (heating up)',
            correct: true,
            feedback:
                'Ka pai, sweet as! You noticed that between these points the data was steadily increasing!',
        },
        {
            label: 'Yes, trending downwards (cooling down)',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
        {
            label: 'No, there is no clear trend (random temperatures)',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
        {
            label: 'Yes, trending constant (same steady temperature)',
            feedback: 'Kāore, take another look at the graph',
        },
    ]}
/>

## Overlapping Graphs with Trinket {#overlap-graphs}

### **Multiple Data Sets in One Graph**

##### Now that we know how to **pull data from a list** and **render a graph**, let's try pulling from **more than one EG sensor** to see how things are related!

<br />

<Figure>
    <ImageWithBorder src={multigraph} />
</Figure>

<br />

#### **Step A)** Data from different sensors:

##### Let's use the <code>linechart.add</code> portion of code to pull from multiple lists:

<ExampleCode>
    {`linechart.add('Air Temp', airtemp_list)
linechart.add('Light', light_list)
linechart.add('Humidity', humidity_list)`}
</ExampleCode>

<br />

##### **25.** With these lines of code above, which lists will the program know to pull from?

<MultiChoiceActivity
    question="Select all that apply:"
    choices={[
        {
            label: 'Air temperature',
            correct: true,
        },
        {
            label: 'Humidity',
            correct: true,
        },
        {
            label: 'Light',
            correct: true,
        },
        {
            label: 'Soil temperature',
        },
        {
            label: 'Soil moisture',
        },
    ]}
    feedback={{
        allCorrect: 'Ka pai! You got them all!',
        someCorrect: 'At least one right!',
        noneCorrect: 'Nope, try again! Tēnā anō',
        notEnough: 'Can you find any more?',
        tooMany:
            "You got all the right ones, but some choices don't fit. Tēnā anō",
    }}
/>

###

#### **Step B)** Input the code into Trinket:

##### Use the **enter** key to insert the lines for the code for the **light sensor data set** into **Line 33** and the **humidity sensor data set** into **Line 34**.

##### Overall it should read like this:

<ExampleCode showLineNumbers startingLineNumber={30}>
    {`linechart = pygal.Line()
linechart.x_labels = map(str, time_list)
linechart.add('Air Temp', airtemp_list)
linechart.add('Light', light_list)
linechart.add('Humidity', humidity_list)
linechart.render()`}
</ExampleCode>

<Trinket trinketId="python/1ea8a2454f" height="600" />

###### _**Note:** Again, remember to take care to get all of the spelling, spaces, and symbols just right!_

###

#### **Step C)** Run the program:

##### When you're ready, click the **run** button to draw your new graph!

<Figure align={'left'}>
    <ImageWithBorder src={run} radius={''} />
</Figure>

###

#### **Step D)** Finding relationships between data sets:

##### Now that you have a graph with multiple sets of data overlapping, let's practise reading the data to find relationships between them.

##### Think about how the values in each data set change over time and what this could mean is actually happening outside in the garden.

<br />

##### Answer these question by comparing all of the different sensor data from your Trinket graph above.

##### **26.** Can you see a **pattern (clear arrangement)** between the **air temperature** and **light levels**?

<br />
